=======

Tool for translation of type comments to type annotations in Python.

This tool requires Python 3.8 to run. But the supported target code version
is Python 3.4+ (can be specified with ``--python-minor-version``).

Currently, the tool translates function and assignment type comments to
type annotations.

The philosophy of of the tool is too minimally invasive, and preserve original
formatting as much as possible. This is why the tool doesn't use un-parse.
